# waveforms

This repository will serve as a collection of notes, simulations, and experiments for various different modulations at the waveform level.
We'll start by looking at the continuous phase modulation (CPM) waveforms defined in the IRIG106 set of standards, since they are standardized in the aeronautical telemetry industry for both their spectral efficiency detection efficiency.
